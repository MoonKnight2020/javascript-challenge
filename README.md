# javascript-challenge

Created a basic HTML web page

Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, wrote code that appends a table to a web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

Made sure there is a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at the very least.

Use a date form in a HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.
